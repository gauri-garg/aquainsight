# **App Name**: AquaInsight

## Core Features:

- Data Unification: Integrate heterogeneous oceanographic, fisheries, and molecular biology datasets into a unified system.
- Interactive Visualization: Provide interactive modules for visualizing otolith shape, morphometrics, taxonomic classifications, and molecular/eDNA data, using charts and graphs.
- eDNA Species Matching: Employ a tool that can assist in automated matching of eDNA data with species identification, thereby streamlining biodiversity assessments.
- Ocean Parameter Influence Analysis: Enable correlation analysis to study how ocean parameters influence biodiversity, fish distribution, and ecosystem health.
- Data Export: Allow users to export processed and analyzed data in multiple standard formats.
- Cross-domain Search: Enable efficient information retrieval via cross-domain metadata tagging that can correlate any set of columns or results across the available data sources.
- User Roles and Authentication: Implement distinct portals for students (read-only, search with filters), researchers (data submission), and CMLRE-approved users (data approval/rejection). CMLRE users require authentication and ID verification.
- Data Submission Workflow: Researchers can upload data in CSV format. Submitted data requires approval by a CMLRE user before being added to the database. Students can request to upload data to CMLRE.
- Data Approval/Rejection: CMLRE users can view, approve, or reject data submissions from researchers. Approved data is then added to the database.
- Filtering and Search: Enable filtering and search functionalities across all data for all user roles.  Students will have read-only access and search capabilities.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sea blue (#297373) to represent the ocean depths.
- Background color: Light grayish-blue (#E0E5E5), provides a neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Seafoam green (#85C48B) to highlight interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a modern and clean interface.
- Use simple, outline-style icons to represent data types, functions, and navigation elements.
- Employ a responsive layout with clear sectioning for easy data discovery and interaction. Use the ocean-ai-suite-ef2eb7c1.base44.app/Dashboard layout as reference.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to guide the user and provide feedback on interactions.
